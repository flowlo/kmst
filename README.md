This is my solution to the [programming challenge](https://www.ads.tuwien.ac.at/w/SS12/186815_Algorithmen_und_Datenstrukturen_2_VU_3.0#Programmieraufgabe) in *[Algorithms and Data Structures 2](https://www.ads.tuwien.ac.at/w/SS12/186815_Algorithmen_und_Datenstrukturen_2_VU_3.0)* at the *[Vienna University of Technology](https://www.tuwien.ac.at/en/)* (summer semester 2012).

The original assignment can be found [here](http://www.ads.tuwien.ac.at/teaching/ss12/AD2/pa_angabe.pdf). Just mail me in case it went offline.

I placed second, and some fellow students asked me to put my code on the internetz.

The core file `src/ads1ss12/pa/KMST.java` is a bit messy, as it also contains my AVL-Tree (because we could only upload a single file), and I currently don't have plans to change this.
